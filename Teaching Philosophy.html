										<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2> 
									</header>
									
									<p>
										As I continue my journey to become a teacher I am reminded that teaching goes beyond the classroom. My passion for education is rooted in my passion for helping others and wanting to support students reach their full potential. I have always wanted to become a teacher and throughout my teaching journey have learnt that effective teaching requires more than passion but a commitnment to foster student growth academically and socially. 
										<br>
										<br>
										Education is about creating life long learners that can thrive in an ever-changing world. My goal as an educator is to equipt my students with the tools to be able to adape to this evolving world. My teaching philosophy revolves around the idea that each student has the ability to succedd and strive when given an evironment where they are supported and encouraged to do their best. To create this for my students I include diversity in my lessons, taking into account the students backgrounds and learning abilities and needs to best cater for them. This allows me to create meaningful relationships with my students in which that can reach their full potential. 
										<br>
										<br>
										I strive to create a safe learning envrionemnt where studnets feel supported and included. Collaboration and communication is important in education, in the classroom as well as amongst parents and carers who are major contributors to students education. Building this strong communication line with the students parents/carers is important to make sure they receive the support they need in all ascpects of their schooling; academically and socially. 
										<br>
										<br>
										As I begin my teaching career my goal is to create a place where students feel comfortable, supported and inspired as learners. I want to create engaging lessons where their creativity and imagination is sparked where they can use critical thinking and problem solving skills.
